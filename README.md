# HABpanel

* copy the entire matrix-theme folder to your Openhab's HTML folder (normally in /etc/openhab2/html)

* in your HABpanel config use orange-tree-overrides.css as the CSS (/static/matrix-theme/orange-tree-overrides.css)

* import the widgets from the widgets folder into HABpanel

* create your own screens using the widgets

* the widgets require no coding, all settings are editable through the HABpanel interface (select items etc)
